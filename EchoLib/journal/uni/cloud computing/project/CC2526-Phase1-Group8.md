## Use Cases
### UC1. Hybrid Initial Profile Creation (Genres + Reference Movies)
- **Actor:**  Newly registered user.
- **Problem:** A new user wants relevant recommendations immediately but has no viewing history on the platform.
- **Description:**
	1.  During registration, the user selects preferred genres and genres to avoid through a simple checklist interface.
	2. Optionally, the user searches for and selects 3–5 movies they consider personal references (*“I love this movie”*).
	3. The system builds a preference vector that combines explicit genre information with inferred patterns derived from the selected reference titles and from similar users.
	4. In the first session after registration, the user receives a homepage organized into distinct shelves: *“Based on Your Genres”*, *“Based on Your Favourite Titles”*, and, if applicable, filtered by the streaming platforms the user has indicated they own.
- **Expected outcome:** Initial recommendations with strong accuracy and diversity, reducing the cold-start problem and increasing the likelihood that the user finds appealing content during their first interaction with the platform.

### UC2. Guided Exploration by Genre Families
- **Actor:**  Registered user.
- **Problem:** The user tends to remain stuck in the same types of content and struggles to discover interesting variations within and around the genres they enjoy.
- **Description:**
	1. The system analyses the database of movies and identifies *“genre families”* based on genre co-occurrence and consumption patterns (e.g., action + sci-fi + superheroes; drama + biography; horror + psychological thriller).
	2. For each user, it calculates which genre families are highly explored (high consumption and strong ratings) and which related families remain underexplored, also considering the behaviour of similar users.
	3. The interface presents shelves such as *“Comfort Zone"*, *“More of the Same, but Different”*, and *“Explore Something New”*, each containing recommendations ranked by the probability of user satisfaction and filtered according to the streaming platforms the user owns.
- **Expected outcome:** A discovery experience that gently encourages users to step slightly outside their comfort zone in a controlled way, increasing content diversity without sacrificing relevance.

### UC3. Inconsistent Consumption Flow Detection System
- **Actor:**  Platform (security team, data science team).
- **Problem:** Sudden changes and atypical consumption or rating patterns may indicate fraud, compromised accounts, or noise that harms the quality of recommendations and the reliability of metrics presented to studios.
- **Description:** 
	1. For each user, the system maintains a routine profile that includes typical viewing times, most-used devices, rating distribution, and most frequent genres.
	2. Anomaly detection algorithms continuously monitor new interactions (views, ratings, reviews) to identify inconsistent flows, such as sudden spikes in completely different genres, sequences of extreme ratings within a short period, or usage from unusual devices or locations.
	3. The system distinguishes between potentially malicious patterns (e.g., coordinated review bombing across many new users) and genuine shifts in taste (gradual and consistent changes over time), applying adaptive rules and models.
	4. Depending on the type of anomaly, it takes actions such as quarantining certain interactions so they do not affect public metrics, requesting additional user verification, or adjusting the weight of certain genres in the profile to reflect a real evolution of interests.
- **Expected outcome:** Greater robustness of recommendations and internal statistics, protection against fraud, and the ability to track the natural evolution of user preferences without overreacting to isolated behaviour.

### UC4. Sentiment and Topic Dashboard by User Segment
- **Actor:**  Studios, production companies, marketing teams, and content strategy teams.
- **Problem:** Textual reviews are numerous and heterogeneous, making it difficult to quickly understand how different audience segments react to a movie or series and which specific aspects generate praise or criticism.
- **Description:**
	1. The system applies Natural Language Processing techniques to automatically classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral, and to extract frequent topics (e.g., plot, acting, pacing, special effects, cinematography).
	2. In parallel, it uses user clusters obtained through clustering techniques based on consumption history, preferred genres, and usage patterns, forming segments such as *“Blockbuster Lovers"*, *“Classic Cinephiles”*, *“Casual Viewers”*,  etc.
	3. For each movie or series, the system aggregates sentiment metrics by segment (e.g., “Classic Cinephiles – 80% positive about the plot; Blockbuster Lovers – 90% positive about special effects; Casual Viewers – 50% neutral overall”) and highlights the most frequently mentioned topics within each group.
	4. These results are presented in an interactive dashboard that allows studios to filter by segment, topic, and time window to track how audience reception evolves over time.
- **Expected outcome:** A structured view of audience reception, enabling more informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, trailers, sequels, creative adjustments, and campaign targeting.

### UC5. Review Fraud Detection
- **Actor:** Platform integrity system. 
- **Problem:** Protecting the integrity of public movie averages from "review bombing." 
- **Description:**
	1. The system uses anomaly detection algorithms (review bombing) to monitor the continuous flow of ratings. The process occurs in real time. 
	2. When it identifies statistically abnormal peaks of extreme ratings from recent or suspicious accounts, the system automatically quarantines these ratings. 
- **Expected outcome:** Secured and credible platform public averages.

### UC6. Gamification with Quests, Streaks, and Genre Exploration
- **Actor:** Registered User
- **Problem:** Even with good recommendations, some users lose motivation, fall into repetitive viewing habits, or stop interacting with the platform (e.g., stop rating, writing reviews, or exploring new content).
- **Description:**
	1. The system introduces gamification mechanics inspired by apps that use streaks, quests, and milestones to increase retention, such as learning platforms and habit-tracking apps.
	2. Daily, weekly, or seasonal missions are defined, for example:
	  - *“Maintain a 3-day streak by watching at least 1 episode/movie per day”*
	  - *“Watch 2 movies from a genre you rarely explore”*
	  - *“Complete a trilogy or an entire season”*
	  - *“Rate 5 titles you recently watched”*
	3. The system automatically tracks progress using viewing history and ratings, adjusting quest difficulty based on the user’s actual behaviour to ensure goals are challenging yet achievable.
	4. Rewards, in the initial phase, focus on intrinsic motivation and platform features:
	   - Profile badges
	   - Extra statistics (genre exploration maps, streak history)
	   - Minor interface unlocks
	   - Early access to some premium analytics features
- **Expected outcome:** Increased user retention, higher volume of user data (ratings, reviews, consumption diversity), and encouragement to explore new genres, which in turn improves the recommendation engine and enriches the analytics offered to studios.

### UC7. Personalized Recommendations for Registered User
