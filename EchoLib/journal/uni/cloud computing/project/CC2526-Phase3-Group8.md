### FR6. Movie List
- System must provide a list of movies with browsing options, including:
    - pagination
    - sorting by title, release date, rating, or popularity
    - filters by genre and year
- The response must include, for each movie: title, poster URL, year, list of genres, and average rating.
- User must be able to click on a movie to access its details.

- Deleting a badge definition must not remove historical records of badges already awarded to users, but must prevent the badge from being awarded in the future.  

### FR12. Award Badges
- System must automatically evaluate user activity (ratings, watchlists, viewing streaks, genre exploration, etc.) to determine when a user meets a badge milestone.  
- When a milestone is met, the system must award the corresponding badge to the user and store the award timestamp.  
- System must expose an operation to manually award or revoke badges for administrative purposes (e.g., correcting errors or running special campaigns).  
- Awarded badges must be visible (if user allows) in the user profile and retrievable via the badges API endpoints.

- Users should be able to add multiple movies to the watchlist after creation.
- The system must validate that the title is not empty.

### FR15. Edit Watchlist
- Users must add or remove movies from watchlists.
- Users must be able to rename a watchlist, as long as the new title does not duplicate another watchlist they own.
- The system must prevent adding the same movie twice.

### FR16. Delete Watchlist
- Users must be able to delete a watchlist they own.
- Deleting a watchlist must also remove all associated movie entries.
- The system must ensure that only the owner can delete their watchlist.

### FR17. Retrieve User Watchlists
- System must be able to retrieve all their watchlists and their contents.
- System must be able to retrieve a single watchlist by its ID.
- Users should be able to filter the contents of a watchlist by genre.

## Subscriptions
### FR18. Subscribe to Plan
- System must allow users to subscribe to a paid plan that unlocks premium features (e.g., advanced analytics, early access to new tools).  
- System must support at least one recurring plan (e.g., monthly) and store subscription start date, plan type and current status.  
- System must validate payment or external billing confirmation before activating a subscription.  

### FR19. Manage Subscription Plan
- Users must be able to view their current subscription status, including plan type, renewal date and payment status.  
- Users must be able to upgrade their free plan.

- For each request to a premium endpoint, the system must validate the user’s subscription status through the Subscriptions service.  
- If the subscription is expired or cancelled, the system must deny access and return an appropriate error, suggesting re‑subscription.  

### FR21. Subscriptions CRUD 
- System must provide administrative operations to create, read, update and cancel subscriptions for support and correction purposes.  
- System must log all subscription lifecycle events (creation, renewal, cancellation, plan changes) for auditing and billing reconciliation.  

## Recommendation
### FR22. Initial Profile Recommendations
- New users must be able to select preferred genres and genres to avoid during the registration process.
- New users must be able to search and select 3 to 5 reference movies.
- The system must build a preference vector based on the user's explicit genre choices, reference titles, and similarities with other users.
- The system must generate tailored homepage shelves such as "Based on Your Genres", "Based on Your Favourite Titles" for the user's first session.
- Users must be able to filter these initial recommendations based on the streaming platforms they own.

### FR23. Personalized Recommendations
- System must analyze a user’s rating history, preferred genres, and interactions to calculate personalized movie and series recommendations.
- System must order the recommended titles by relevance and probability of user satisfaction.
- System must update recommendations dynamically as the user rates new titles or alters their watchlists.

### FR24. Genre Family Exploration
- System must group movies into "genre families" by analysing genre co-occurrence and overall user consumption patterns.
- System must calculate and categorize each user's consumption into highly explored and underexplored genre families.
- System must generate distinct discovery shelves for the user interface, such as "Comfort Zone" and "Explore Something New"

## Fraud Detection
### FR25. Detect Inconsistent Consumption
- System must continuously monitor user interactions (views, ratings, reviews) to detect anomalous patterns that may indicate fraud, compromised accounts, or bot activity.
- Anomaly detection should consider, among others:
    - sudden spikes in activity within a short period
    - extreme ratings (e.g. 1 or 10) coming from new recent accounts or accounts with very little history
    - unusual device or geographic location patterns
    - coordinated behavior across multiple accounts (e.g., same IP address, similar timings)
    - significant deviations from a user's typical behavior profile (viewing times, preferred genres, rating distribution, etc.)
- System must distinguish between potentially malicious patterns and genuine shifts in taste, using adaptative models where feasible.
- Detected anomalies must be flagged for further analysis or automatic action.

### FR26. Review Fraud Treatment
- When a rating or review is identified as potentially fraudulent (e.g., part of review bombing), the system must quarantine it:
    - Exclude it from public averages, recommendations, and studio analytics.
    - Store quarantine metadata (reason, timestamp, user)
- Quarantined items must be reviewed by administrators, who can either restore them or permanently mark them as fraudulent.
- The system must maintain a log of all fraud detection events and actions taken.

## Studio Analytics
### FR27. Sentiment Analysis
- System must automatically process user text reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- System must classify each processed review into sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral.
- System must aggregate these sentiment metrics to calculate an overall sentiment score for each movie or series.

### FR28. Topic Extraction
- System must analyze reviews to extract frequently mentioned topics (e.g., plot, acting, special effects, pacing).
- System must generate automated summaries highlighting the most frequent strengths and weaknesses mentioned by the audience.

### FR29. User Cluster Analytics 
- System must group users into distinct segments (clusters) based on consumption history, preferred genres, and usage patterns.
- System must correlate and aggregate the extracted sentiments and topics specific to each user segment (e.g., showing how 'Casual Viewers' vs. 'Cinephiles' reacted to the same movie).

## Architecture Description 
- The system follows a modular, service‑oriented architecture designed for a cloud‑native environment.
- Each functional domain (movies, ratings, watchlists, analytics, etc.) is implemented as an independent backend service.
- All services are exposed through a unified API Gateway, which acts as the single public entry point.

- This architecture directly reflects the functional requirements defined earlier and supports future deployment on Kubernetes.

### API Gateway
The API Gateway is responsible for:
- Routing incoming REST requests to the appropriate backend service
- Enforcing authentication (OAuth2.0)
- Providing a single stable endpoint for all clients
- Applying request validation and basic rate limiting

This ensures that clients interact with a single, consistent API, regardless of internal service structure.
### Microservices
- Each service corresponds to a functional domain and maps directly to the OpenAPI specification and functional requirements.

| Microservice     | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User Management  | Registration, authentication, profile updates, OAuth2 integration       |
| Movie Catalog    | Movie CRUD, search, filtering, metadata retrieval                       |

| Badges           | Badge definitions, awarding logic, user achievements                    |
| Watchlists       | CRUD watchlists, add/remove movies, filtering                           |
| Subscriptions    | Subscription lifecycle, plan management, premium access control         |
| Recomendation    | Hybrid recommendations, genre families and personalised recommendations |
| Fraud Detection  | Anomaly detection, review bombing mitigation, quarantine logic          |
| Studio Analytics | NLP sentiment analysis, topic extraction, user cluster analytics        |
